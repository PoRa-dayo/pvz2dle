RANGE: (Tile and Touch affects all zombies by default (if not use with Single area), all other Range affects a single zombie by default (if not use with Multi-Hit))
Tile - ability affects all zombies on its tile
Touch - ability affects zombies near its tile (enough for the zombie to eat it) (if it only affects 1 zombie then it's used along with Area: Single)
Close - 1 tile ahead of the plant (can be combined with Front & Back)
X Tiles Ahead - range spans x tiles in front of the plant, on its lane (if it's not single then use the XxY area)
Straight - straight-shot projectile, ahead of the plant, on its lane (can be combined with Front & Back)
Lobbed - lobbed projectile, ahead of the plant, on its lane (can be combined with Front & Back)
Ahead - not a single-hit-straight-shot or lobbed projectile, ahead of the plant, on its lane
Multi-Lane - ability affects multiple lanes, but no Multi-Hit on each lane
X Way - unique trajectory in X directions

AREA: (Special with the Rush ability does not count towards Range/Area unless it's the plant's main ability, Tap To Aim COUNTS AS FULL BOARD)
Single - ability only affects a single zombie over the entirety of the plant's lifespan, only used with Touch range
XxY - ability affects every zombie in a XxY area
Lane - ability affects every zombie on its lane
Column - ability affects every zombie on its column
Column X - ability affects every zombie on column X
X Columns - ability affects every zombie on X columns
Multi-Hit - ability affects multiple zombies that doesn't fit the other Area stats, not used with Touch range (if it bounces like Bowling Bulb or Grapeshot then Shot Bounces is listed in Special, if it arcs the way Lightning Reed does then Zombies Zapped is listed)
Full Board - self-explanatory (does not imply whether it can target one or multiple zombies at once, but who fucking cares, unless it has separate abilities that don't have Full Board range at all)
